ParaSwap aggregates several DeFi services and make them available in one comprehensive interface. This handbook provides guidance to better understand ParaSwap's context and how to make the most of it.

It details the requirement to start using ParaSwap ([âž¡ Getting Started]({{< relref path="/content/docs/quickstart.md" >}}) section), as well as why it makes sense to interact with DeFi using middleware. Finally, it provides you with a comprehensive overview of all the services ParaSwap's interact with.

If you've never heard of Ethereum and the decentralized finance ecosystem growing on top of it, we recommend you to check **[ðŸ‘‰ EthHub - What Is Decentralized Finance?](https://docs.ethhub.io/built-on-ethereum/open-finance/what-is-open-finance/)** - a community-driven effort providing a comprehensive overview of the DeFi ecosystem.

### First, you need a wallet

{{< notice tip >}}
While initializing a wallet, make sure to properly set up and back up your recovery mechanism (such as the seed phrase).
{{< /notice >}}

Ethereum's DeFi operates in a permissionless manner: there are no checks required to use a given DeFi service. All you need to get aboard is a wallet - used to store and secure your assets:

**[ðŸ¦Š MetaMask](https://metamask.io/)** is the most commonly used wallet to interact with DeFi services.
