This handbook provides context to better understand ParaSwap's context and how to make the most of it.

It details the requirement to start using ParaSwap ([‚û° Getting Started]({{< relref path="/content/docs/quickstart.md" >}}) section), as well as why it makes sense to interact with DeFi using middleware. Finally, it will provide you with a comprehensive overview of all the services ParaSwap's interact with and their hedge.

ParaSwap aggregates several DeFi services and make them available in one comprehensive interface. If you've never heard of Ethereum and the decentralised finance ecosystem growing on top of it, we recommend you to check this introduction resource:

### First, you need a wallet

{{< notice tip >}}
If you are setting up a wallet for the first time, make sure to properly set and back up your recovery mechanism (such as the seed phrase).
{{< /notice >}}

Ethereum's DeFi operates in a permissionless manner: there are no checks required to use a given DeFi service. All you need to get aboard is a wallet - used to store and secure your assets. Here are two common and proven options:

1. **[ü¶ä MetaMask](https://metamask.io/)**
2. **[üîê Gnosis Safe](https://gnosis-safe.io/)**





### You're now ready to DeFi!

With a wallet secured, you have everything you need to interact with ParaSwap and any other decentralised finance services.
