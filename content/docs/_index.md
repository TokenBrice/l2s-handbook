---

ParaSwap aggregates several DeFi services and make them available in one comprehensive interface. If you've never heard of Ethereum and the decentralised finance ecosystem growing on top of it, we recommend you to check this introduction resource:

- **[EthHub - Decentralized Finance Overview](https://docs.ethhub.io/built-on-ethereum/open-finance/what-is-open-finance/)**
- **[Consensys - Blockchain for Decentralized Finance (DeFi)](https://consensys.net/blockchain-use-cases/decentralized-finance/)**

### First, you need a wallet

Ethereum's DeFi operates in a permissionless manner: there are no checks required to use a given DeFi service. All you need to get aboard is a wallet - used to store and secure your assets. Here are two common and proven options:

1. **[ü¶ä MetaMask](https://metamask.io/)**
2. **[üîê Gnosis Safe](https://gnosis-safe.io/)**

### You're now ready to DeFi!

With a wallet secured, you have everything you need to interact with ParaSwap and any other decentralised finance services.
