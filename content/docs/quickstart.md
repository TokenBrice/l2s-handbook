ParaSwap is a middleware streamlining users interactions with various DeFi services. It pools liquidity from the main decentralised exchanges together in a convenient interface abstracting most of the swaps' complexity to make it convenient and accessible for end-users.

This article is a quickstart resource - it helps users better understand ParaSwap and how to use it.

### Main Features

ParaSwap facilitates the exchange of Ethereum tokens, abstracting most of the complexity now required to conduct trades at the best market rates.

ParaSwap abstracts the complexity of comparing prices (factoring gas costs and other variables) for you â€” so you can focus on your trading strategy or learning more about the fundamentals of the space.

### Swap & Transfer
If you're swapping tokens to send to somewhere else, consider swap & transfer. It's exactly the same as the previous simple swap, except this time the tokens obtained are sent to another address.
